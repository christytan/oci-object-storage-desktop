## OCI Object Storage Desktop Client

![OCI Object Storage Screenshot](/img/example.png?raw=true)

This is an UNOFFICIAL desktop client to interact with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service. Please use at your own discretion. This application is not affiliated with Oracle or is an official product of Oracle. I created this to expose some of the functionality of OCI's object storage hidden behind the command-line interface and the SDK to a simple to use GUI. With this application, you can create buckets, upload multiple folders and files of any size, retry failed file uploads, and switch between buckets, compartments, and tenancies with ease.
